Title: An alignment and integration method for single cell genomics
Description: An unsupervised deep learning method for data alignment, integration and estimation of per-cell differences in -omic data (e.g. gene expression) across datasets (conditions, tissues, species). See Johansen and Quon (2019) <doi:10.1101/504944> for more details.
